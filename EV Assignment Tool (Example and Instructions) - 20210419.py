EV Assignment Tool

This script gives an EV-to-charging station assignment tool with M/D/C charging station queueing.
The tool outputs the assignment matrix, the access cost matrix, as well as the expected wait time
and utilization ratio of charging stations, and average access cost of the origins. It could be 
used to evaluate current or designed EV charging station configurations. 

The EV assignment is formulated as a capacitated user equilibrium (UE) problem, originally
introduced in Beckman et al. (1956), to capture users’ charging station choice. At UE, charging
stations used by the EVs from the same origin should have the smallest and the same access cost
(travel cost + waiting cost). The capacity if charging station is reflected in the M/D/C queueing
model, which assumes users arrive sufficiently randomly while charging time is deterministic
(e.g. an empty tank will take half hour to fully recharge in a DCFC). Because there is no closed
form expression for an M/D/C model, we make use of an approximation from Barceló et al. (1996).
The model is solved using a Method of Successive Averages which guarantees convergence for convex
problems like this one (Powell and Sheffi, 1982). 

The following example demonstrate how the tool works.
